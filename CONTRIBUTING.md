# Contributing to Body IQ

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Body IQ — an open-source, evidence-based exercise and movement knowledge engine.

## 🎯 Mission

Body IQ aims to give everyone free access to accurate, research-backed exercise information including:
- How to perform exercises with proper form
- Which muscles are involved and at what activation levels
- Evidence-based dosing (sets, reps, frequency)
- Easier and harder variations
- Why the exercise matters for daily life

## 🧬 Data Quality Standards

This project values **accuracy over volume**. Every contribution must follow these rules:

### Evidence Requirements
- Muscle role assignments (primary/secondary/stabilizer/synergist) must be backed by EMG research where available
- Dosing recommendations must cite RCTs, systematic reviews, or clinical practice guidelines
- If you're unsure, mark confidence as low rather than guessing
- Do not fabricate citations — all references must be real, verifiable papers

### Confidence Scoring
- **0.95**: Verified by multiple high-quality sources (systematic reviews, Cochrane reviews)
- **0.90**: Supported by at least one RCT or established textbook
- **0.85**: Supported by observational studies or expert consensus
- **0.80**: Based on anatomical/biomechanical reasoning, limited direct evidence
- **< 0.80**: Needs review — flag for evidence gathering

### Validation Statuses
- `draft` → Initial entry, not yet reviewed
- `needs_review` → Flagged for expert review
- `reviewed` → Reviewed by a qualified contributor
- `verified` → Confirmed by multiple reviewers with strong evidence
- `disputed` → Conflicting evidence or disagreement

## 📋 Types of Contributions

### 1. Exercise Data (Most Needed)
- Add new exercises with full descriptions, cues, regressions, progressions
- Improve existing exercise descriptions for clarity
- Add or correct muscle role assignments with EMG citations
- Add dosing recommendations from clinical trials
- Add evidence-based coaching cues

### 2. Anatomy Data
- Correct muscle origin/insertion/action/innervation/blood supply
- Add missing movement-muscle links
- Verify or dispute existing mappings

### 3. Research Sources
- Add new peer-reviewed sources that support exercise or anatomy claims
- Link sources to specific exercises, muscles, or movements
- Flag outdated or retracted sources

### 4. Functional Tasks
- Add new ADL/IADL tasks with movement requirements
- Add ROM thresholds and strength requirements from clinical literature
- Link tasks to exercises

### 5. Media (Future)
- Exercise demonstration photos or illustrations
- Video links to proper form demonstrations
- Accessibility-friendly descriptions of movements

### 6. Code & UI
- Bug fixes
- UI improvements for the exercise explorer
- API improvements
- Accessibility enhancements
- Mobile responsiveness
