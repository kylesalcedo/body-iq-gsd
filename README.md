# Body IQ — Movement Knowledge Engine

A validation-first biomechanics and physical therapy knowledge system that structures movement knowledge into a queryable, reviewable knowledge graph.

## What It Does

Models the full biomechanics chain:

**Region → Joint → Movement → Muscle (O/I/A/N/B) → Functional Task → Exercise (cues, regressions, progressions) → Evidence**

Every entity carries validation metadata (status, confidence, sources, editorial notes). Muscle-movement and muscle-exercise relationships are **weighted by role** (primary, secondary, stabilizer, synergist).

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL 14+ (running on localhost:5432)
- pnpm

### Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Copy environment file and configure DATABASE_URL
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your PostgreSQL connection string if different from default

# Push schema to database
pnpm db:push

# Seed the knowledge graph
pnpm db:seed

# Start the dev server
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the explorer.

- **111 free fulltext articles** with direct links (86 with PDF URLs)
- Sources resolved via PubMed, CrossRef, and Europe PMC APIs
- Re-run resolution: `npx tsx scripts/resolve-sources.ts`

### Regions Covered

Cervical Spine, Thoracic Spine, Shoulder, Elbow, Wrist, Hand, Lumbar Spine, Hip, Knee, Ankle

### Evidence-Based Exercise Coverage

117 exercises across all 10 regions, each with research-backed muscle activation data, dosing recommendations, cues, regressions, progressions, and evidence notes with citations. Sources span 309 peer-reviewed references (1980–2026).

### Muscle Role Weighting

Every movement-muscle and exercise-muscle relationship includes a role:

- **Primary** — main mover for this action
- **Secondary** — significant contributor
- **Stabilizer** — stabilizes the joint during the action
- **Synergist** — assists the primary mover
- **Common Association** — frequently associated but not a direct mover

## Explorer UI

The web explorer provides:

- **Dashboard** — counts for all entity types with quick navigation
- **Entity list pages** — all entity types with status badges and confidence indicators
- **Entity detail pages** — full anatomy (O/I/A/N/B), weighted muscle roles, related entities, sources
- **Exercise Finder** — filter by region, joint, movement, muscle, functional task, role, status, confidence
- **Sources** — filter by free fulltext / PDF available, with direct download links
- **Validation Queue** — lists draft items, low confidence entries, items flagged for review
- **API Reference** — interactive API docs with live "Try it" explorer
- **Global Search** — search across all entity types with debounced instant results
- **Sidebar Navigation** — Regions, Joints, Movements, Muscles, Tasks, Exercises, Sources, API Reference, Validation Queue

## API

All endpoints return JSON. Interactive docs at [/api-docs](http://localhost:3000/api-docs).

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GET /api/stats` | Knowledge graph statistics |
| `GET /api/search?q=` | Search across all entity types |
| `GET /api/exercises` | List/filter exercises (region, muscle, movement, task, role, status, confidence) |
| `GET /api/exercises/:slug` | Full exercise detail with muscles, movements, cues, sources |
| `GET /api/exercises/filters` | Available filter options |
| `GET /api/muscles` | List/search muscles |
| `GET /api/sources` | Sources with fulltext/PDF filtering |

### RAG Integration

Get all sources with free PDF links for RAG ingestion:

```
GET /api/sources?filter=pdf&format=rag
```

Returns 75 sources with direct PMC PDF URLs, minimal payload (slug, title, authors, year, journal, doi, pmid, pmcid, fulltextUrl, pdfUrl).

## Scripts

```bash
pnpm dev              # Start dev server
pnpm build            # Production build
pnpm db:push          # Push Prisma schema to database
pnpm db:seed          # Seed the knowledge graph (idempotent)
pnpm db:studio        # Open Prisma Studio
pnpm db:generate      # Regenerate Prisma client
pnpm validate:schemas # Run Zod schema validation tests
pnpm data:quality     # Run data quality checks
```

### Source Resolution

```bash
# Resolve DOIs, PMIDs, PMC IDs, and free fulltext URLs for all sources
npx tsx scripts/resolve-sources.ts
```

Uses PubMed, CrossRef, and Europe PMC APIs (no auth required). Results cached in `scripts/resolved-sources.json`.

## Adding New Exercises

The standard workflow for adding exercises:

1. **Create a research prompt** in `prompts/` listing the exercises with specific questions about EMG data, dosing, clinical indications, and citations
2. **Run the prompt** through OpenEvidence or a similar clinical evidence tool
3. **Save the response** in `research/` for reference
4. **Add exercises** to `prisma/seed/exercises.ts` following the existing format (slug, name, description, muscles, movements, cues, regressions, progressions, sources)
5. **Add new sources** to `prisma/seed/sources.ts` with citation metadata
6. **Resolve source identifiers**: `npx tsx scripts/resolve-sources.ts` — fetches DOIs, PMIDs, PMC IDs, and free fulltext/PDF links
7. **Merge resolved data** back into sources.ts: `npx tsx scripts/merge-resolved-sources.ts`
8. **Seed the database**: `pnpm db:seed`
9. **Verify** in the explorer UI and update README counts

Each exercise should include:
- Target muscles with roles (primary, secondary, stabilizer)
- Evidence-based dosing from RCTs or systematic reviews
- 3-5 coaching cues
- At least 2 regressions and 2 progressions
- Linked research sources with citations

## Data Quality Checks

The `pnpm data:quality` script detects:

- Orphan movements (no muscle associations)
- Orphan muscles (no movement or exercise associations)
- Exercises without cues
- Exercises without regressions/progressions
- Entities missing research sources
- Low confidence entries (< 50%)
- Cross-type slug collisions

## Validation Framework

Every entity supports a 4-layer validation model:

1. **Structural** — schema constraints, FK integrity, required fields
2. **Editorial** — human reviewer judgment on accuracy and usefulness
3. **Evidence** — linked research sources with confidence scoring
4. **Product** — data completeness for downstream use (validation queue)

Entity statuses: `draft` → `needs_review` → `reviewed` → `verified` (or `disputed`)
