# Wiki Index

Institutional memory for **Body IQ**. Domain facts live in the database
(`prisma/seed/**`) and the explorer UI — this wiki records the *why* and the
*how*. See [[../WIKI]] for the schema and rules.

## Start here
- [[overview]] — what Body IQ is, current state, key concepts
- [[stack]] — tech stack with versions and rationale
- [[backlog]] — planned features (dataset export, MCP server, stack builder, explainability)
- [[log]] — chronological activity record

## Concepts
- [[concepts/knowledge-graph-model]] — the entity/relationship model and role weighting
- [[concepts/validation-lifecycle]] — status + confidence, how entities mature
- [[concepts/data-pipeline]] — authoring → sourcing → cue-quality → seed; the extension pattern
- [[concepts/source-resolution]] — how citations are resolved via PubMed / CrossRef / Europe PMC
- [[concepts/api-contract]] — the frozen v1 API surface and its discipline
- [[concepts/explorer-ui]] — the Next.js explorer: pages, query layer, new discovery views
- [[concepts/static-demo]] — the static GitHub Pages build (no backend needed)

- [[decisions/2026-07-04-nav-and-discovery-ux]] — grouped nav + discovery-view UX refinements
- [[decisions/2026-07-04-validator-agent]] — report-only, human-in-the-loop validation assistant
